Current description of expected data formats for what is in the database. There are currently no checks built into the backend for ensuring that data is in this format.
"_id" IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY MongoDB,  DO NOT MESS WITH IT

Users: {"_id", "name", "email", "password"} Key: Email
Lists: {"_id", "listName", "user(s)", "item(s)"} Key: listName
Items: {"_id", "itemName", "price", "category", (for purchased items:) "retailer", "purchaseDate"} Key: itemName
Retailers: {"_id", "retailerName"} Key: retailerName

Things to test: Sublists for tags (ex: for lists.user(s) => {James, Drew, Andrew, etc.})
